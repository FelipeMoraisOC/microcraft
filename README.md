Some of the neat extras:
- Mithril (new material)
- Iron/Gold/Mithril armor
- Fancy lighting system
- Skeleton archers
- Blue and red slimes
- Cool new air wizard powers
- Character customization
- and much more...

## Building
- Mac: `$ ./package.sh` creates `Microcraft-1.0.dmg` which contains runnable. MICROCRAFT.app.
- Windows: `package.bat` creates `MICROCRAFT-1.0.exe` file which installs MICROCRAFT.
- With any OS and a valid JDK 14+ install, both `package.{sh, bat}` create `out\artifacts\Microcraft_jar\Microcraft.jar` which can be run on its own with `java -jar out\artifacts\Microcraft_jar\Microcraft.jar`
